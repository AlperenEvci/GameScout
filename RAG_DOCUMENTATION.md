# RAG System Documentation

## Overview

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a hybrid AI architecture that combines information retrieval with text generation. RAG systems enhance LLM responses by retrieving relevant knowledge from a database before generating answers, making responses more factual, relevant, and up-to-date.

## Components of a RAG System

### 1. Knowledge Base Creation

- **Document Collection**: Gathering relevant documents from various sources
- **Document Processing**: Cleaning, formatting, and chunking documents
- **Embedding Generation**: Converting text chunks into vector representations
- **Vector Database**: Storing and indexing the embeddings for efficient similarity search

### 2. Retrieval Pipeline

- **Query Understanding**: Processing user questions
- **Query Embedding**: Converting the query into the same vector space as the documents
- **Similarity Search**: Finding document chunks that are semantically related to the query
- **Context Selection**: Choosing which retrieved chunks to include in the prompt

### 3. Generation Component

- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts with retrieved context
- **LLM Integration**: Sending the prompt to an LLM for response generation
- **Response Post-processing**: Cleaning, formatting, and enhancing the generated text

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Documents

1. Collect relevant documents (web scraping, PDFs, textbooks, etc.)
2. Clean and normalize text (remove unnecessary formatting, standardize structure)
3. Split documents into chunks
   - Chunk size: 512-1024 tokens is common
   - Include overlap between chunks (100-200 tokens) to maintain context

### Step 2: Create Embeddings

1. Choose an embedding model
   - Options: Sentence-BERT models, OpenAI embeddings, BAAI embeddings
   - Current system: BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 (good balance of quality and efficiency)
2. Generate embeddings for all document chunks
3. Store in a vector database
   - FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) provides efficient similarity search
   - Other options: Pinecone, Milvus, Qdrant, Chromadb

### Step 3: Implement Retrieval Logic

1. Convert user query to a vector embedding
2. Search vector database for similar documents
3. Implement hybrid search for better results
   - Combine dense retrieval (vector similarity) with sparse retrieval (keyword matching)
4. Rerank results to prioritize most relevant chunks

### Step 4: Design Prompts

1. Create templates for injecting retrieved context
2. Include clear instructions for the LLM
3. Use a format that clearly separates:
   - System instructions
   - Retrieved content
   - User query
   - Expected answer format

### Step 5: Connect to LLM

1. Choose an LLM provider (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, etc.)
2. Implement API integration with error handling
3. Set appropriate parameters (temperature, max tokens)

### Step 6: Enhance the System

1. Implement caching for common queries
2. Add query reformulation techniques
3. Create fallback mechanisms for when retrieval fails
4. Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement

## Optimization Techniques

### Improving Retrieval

- **Hybrid search**: Combine semantic search with keyword matching
- **Chunking strategies**: Experiment with different sizes and overlap
- **Metadata filtering**: Use document metadata to narrow search results
- **Reranking**: Apply a second-stage model to rerank results

### Enhancing Generation

- **Chain-of-thought prompting**: Guide the LLM through reasoning steps
- **Response validation**: Check if the response uses the retrieved context
- **Citation tracking**: Include sources for generated information

## Using the GameScout RAG System

### Training the System

1. Run the indexer to create the knowledge base:

```bash
python retrain_rag.py --rebuild-all
```

2. Optimize the index for better search performance:

```bash
python retrain_rag.py --optimize-index
```

3. Test the system with sample questions:

```bash
python retrain_rag.py --test
```

### Customizing the System

1. Update the embedding model in `embedder.py`
2. Modify chunking strategy in `embedder.py`
3. Adjust the retrieval parameters in `query.py`
4. Refine prompt templates in `agent/rag.py`

## Performance Considerations

- Balance between retrieval quality and speed
- Consider RAM usage when scaling vector database
- Monitor token usage when integrating with paid LLMs
- Cache common queries to reduce API calls

## Troubleshooting

- Check embedding quality with visualization tools
- Validate chunk sizes and document coverage
- Test retrieval with known questions
- Analyze LLM responses for hallucinations

## Latest Best Practices (2025)

### Advanced Chunking Strategies

- **Semantic chunking**: Split documents based on topic shifts rather than fixed token counts
- **Hierarchical chunking**: Create both fine-grained and coarse chunks for multi-level retrieval
- **Entity-based chunking**: Keep information about the same entity together

### Modern Embedding Models

- **Multilingual models**: Support for cross-language retrieval
- **Domain-specific fine-tuning**: Adapt embeddings for your specific knowledge domain
- **Contrastive learning**: Improved semantic similarity understanding

### Hybrid Retrieval Systems

- **BM25 + dense vectors**: Combine keyword and semantic search
- **Multi-vector retrieval**: Represent documents with multiple vectors for different aspects
- **Query expansion**: Automatically expand queries with related terms

### Prompt Engineering Innovations

- **Chain-of-thought retrieval**: Multi-step retrieval with reasoning
- **Self-critique**: Have the LLM evaluate its own retrieval quality
- **Dynamic prompting**: Adjust prompts based on retrieval confidence

### Performance Optimizations

- **Vector quantization**: Compress embeddings for faster search
- **GPU acceleration**: Use GPU for both embedding and search
- **Tiered caching**: Multiple levels of caching for different query types

### Evaluation Frameworks

- **RAGAs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment)**: Standardized evaluation metrics
- **Faithfulness scoring**: Measure how well responses stick to retrieved facts
- **Hallucination detection**: Automatically identify unsupported statements
